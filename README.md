# backtrader_binance_futures
Binance API integration with [Backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader).

With this integration you can do:
 - Backtesting your strategy on historical data from the exchange [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=200640624 ) + [Backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader )  // Backtesting 
 - Launch trading systems for automatic trading on the exchange [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=200640624) + [Backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader ) // Live trading

### Getting started
To make it easier to figure out how everything works, many examples have been made in the folders **DataExamplesBinance** and **StrategyExamplesBinance**.

Before running the example, you need to get your API key and Secret key, and put them in the file **ConfigBinance\Config.py:**

```python
# content of ConfigBinance\Config.py 
class Config:
    BINANCE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    BINANCE_API_SECRET = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

#### How to get a Binance API token:
1. Register your account on [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=200640624 )
2. Go to the ["API Management"](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management?ref=CPA_004RZBKQWK ) 
3. Then click the "Create API" button and select "System Generated".
4. In the "API Restrictions" section, enable "Enable Spot and Margin Trading".
5. Copy and paste to the file **ConfigBinance\Config.py ** received **"API key"** and **"Secret key"**

#### Now you can run examples

# Backtrader 时区问题修复

这个库提供了解决 Backtrader 常见时区问题的解决方案，特别是 `'Lines_LineSeries_DataSeries_OHLC_OHLCDateTime_Abst' object has no attribute '_tz'` 错误。

## 问题描述

在使用 Backtrader 进行回测时，尤其是与 PyFolio 分析器结合使用时，可能会遇到以下错误：

```
Trial encountered an error: 'Lines_LineSeries_DataSeries_OHLC_OHLCDateTime_Abst' object has no attribute '_tz'
```

这个错误主要是由于 Pandas 数据帧中带有时区信息的索引与 Backtrader 内部数据结构不兼容造成的。

## 解决方案

提供了两种解决方案：

### 方法1：使用修复脚本 (推荐)

1. 将 `fix_backtrader_tz_issue.py` 文件复制到您的项目目录中
2. 在导入 backtrader 之前先导入此修复模块：

```python
import fix_backtrader_tz_issue  # 必须在导入backtrader之前
import backtrader as bt
```

此脚本通过 Monkey patching 修改了 Backtrader 的关键类和方法，确保它们能够正确处理时区信息。

### 方法2：修改数据加载和处理代码

如果不想使用修复脚本，可以在代码中手动处理时区问题：

1. 数据加载时移除时区信息：

```python
# 读取数据时确保没有时区信息
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'], utc=False)

# 设置索引时确保没有时区信息
df.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)
if hasattr(df.index, 'tz') and df.index.tz is not None:
    df.index = df.index.tz_localize(None)
```

2. 处理 PyFolio 返回的数据：

```python
portfolio_stats = strat.analyzers.pyfolio.get_pf_items()
returns = portfolio_stats[0]
if hasattr(returns.index, 'tz') and returns.index.tz is not None:
    returns.index = returns.index.tz_localize(None)
```

## 验证修复

提供了测试脚本 `test_fix.py` 来验证修复是否有效：

```bash
python test_fix.py
```

如果正常运行，说明修复成功。

## 故障排除

如果修复后仍然出现问题，请尝试以下方法：

1. 确保在导入 backtrader 之前导入修复脚本
2. 检查 pandas 和 backtrader 的版本兼容性
3. 在数据处理过程中明确检查时区信息

## 兼容性

已在以下环境中测试:
- Python 3.7+
- Backtrader 1.9.74+
- Pandas 1.1.0+

## 贡献

欢迎提交问题和改进建议。
